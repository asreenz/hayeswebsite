        Being gay is hard. Being black and gay is even harder. Being black, gay, and poor is harder still. When people possess all three of these traits, the oppressions and abuses set aside for each are compounded by one another. These oppressions and abuses create the need for a specific language, a common cultural tongue between members of this marginalized community. I will be examining the linguistic character presented in the FX show Pose... <a href="pose.html" class="pose-link">(click for more)</a></h3>

</div>
    <h3 class="marcoparagraph">
        I spent every summer for the past fourteen summers in Jackson, Mississippi. I attended and later worked at Strong River Camp and Farm, a traditionalist summer camp painted by visions of canoes and arrows. These summers spent freezing in a cold river and baking under Dixie sun are some of my most cherished childhood memories. At the end of my last summer, I stood by a pond overseeing children splashing in muddy water while their compatriots slathered their faces and tongues with raw honey, right from the comb... <a href="marco.html" class="marco-link">(click for more)</a>

        <h2 class="teen-title">Concerning Teen Sexuality on Film</h2>
    </div>
    <h3 class="teenparagraph">
        Teenagers have sex. Right? This seems like a universal truth. Our adolescence is a critical period of sexual discovery, experimentation, and foundational growth. These experiences we have in our youth inform the way we will perceive our own bodies, romantic relationships, and intimacy throughout life. So why do movies about teenagers get it so monumentally, hilariously wrong?

        There is a dichotomy in films that handle teen subjects. Sometimes, the characters are presented as sexless, chaste automatons. Movies like Love, Simon and To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before take this approach. Whatever sexual behavior or intimacy depicted in films...<a href="teen.html" class="teen-link"> (click for more)</a>

    </div>
        <h3 class="roughparagraph">
    Skin soft stretched taut against clavicle bone
waistband elastic worn loose and string untied
my little raging rough sleeper bed sheets discarded
curled hair as a nest my hand perched as bird’s wing.
A little discretion text from your mother hand on my arm 
feel not well feel very well aching as aching subsides.
Body against body I can taste copper on my tongue
finger tip against rib pulse felt and pineal nightmare drips
from leaky faucet my water is never warm it is always cold 
do you want to be my fake everything my artificial lover 
my hypothetical little baby baby never felt so comfortable in
repose like statue carved into sensuous fold and sinew.
Birthmark like spilled milk over left eyebrow isolated flaw
loving little thing spoiled little thing child made rotten by 
shifting summer skins and trails of my haze smoke
Inhale to bitter lung bitter lung gives way to bitter heart
Eyes like vapor, touch like vapor, impermanent and lovely.
